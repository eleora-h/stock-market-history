# STOCK MARKET HISTORY

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple Python commmand-line interpreter that fetches stocks from the Polygon.io API and implements some basic interactions, such as visualizing stock trends over time. 
This is extremely basic, and there is significant room for improvement in terms of the menu, use cases, and potentially adding machine learning to guess at future stock trends. Frankly, I didn't find this a particularly engaging project and went with the MVP to showcase code structure and style.

In order to use, you will need to create an account at Polygon.io and add your credentials as seen in the credentials.example file. Simply run the main.py file to start up the program.
